CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED  RESPONSES  Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural  language processing and conversation flow.
